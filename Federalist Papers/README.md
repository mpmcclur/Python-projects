The Federalist Papers dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/morenoh149/the-federalist-papers) is explored with the intent to classify the "disputed" papers into one of the three authors: Hamilton, Madison, or Jay. K-means clustering and decision tree models are used to classify the papers. Both .py and .jupyter files are available.
