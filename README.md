# Python-projects Repository
Machine learning, time-series forecasting, and other miscellaneous projects scripted in Python are presented here. The folder names represent the dataset/subject, and the files within the folder are named after the approach/model/algorithm used. Each folder contains a README for an introduction to the project as well as code (.PY or .IPYNB). Files existing outside a folder are not projects but rather coding exercises using a particular dataset. Many of these projects are Python-scripted versions of projects found in my R repository.
