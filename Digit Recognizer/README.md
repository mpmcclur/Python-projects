# Intro
Kaggle's "Digit Recognizer" (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) dataset is explored to compare classification techniques, namely decision trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), linear support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). Both .py and .jupyter files are available.

The original dataset is too large, so I've included a smaller version of each dataset used for training and testing.
