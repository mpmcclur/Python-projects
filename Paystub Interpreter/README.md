# Intro
This program imports PDF-formatted paystubs and exports select information to a .CSV file. It extracts information from current (2018, onward) paystubs but can also pull select information from pre-2018 paystubs, which isn't recommended due to inconsistent formatting (hence, the correct information isn't always identified). The program can be used as a one-off export, or it can extract information from multiple paystubs at a time.
