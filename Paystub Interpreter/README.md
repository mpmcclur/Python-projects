#Intro
I wrote this program to easily and efficiently export select information from each PDF-formatted paystub. It extracts information from current (2018, onward) paystubs but can also pull select information from pre-2018 paystubs, the format of which is inconsistent.

The program exports information into a tabular .XLSX file, and can be used as a one-off export or a running extracting of multiple paystubs.
